<p style="font-family: Arial;">On the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Saturdays, <strong><span style="color: rgb(227, 108, 9);">only 1 x skeet and 1 x DTL</span></strong> layout will be open from 9.30
    am until midday.&nbsp; This allows us to accommodate the novice and corporate groups on the other layouts.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">There will be <strong>no</strong> extension to practice times on the 4th Saturday to allow the sporting guys the time to safely set up for the following
    days' competition.
    <br />
</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">There is no change to unlicensed shooter times.
    <br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To keep shooting costs down, the club is run purely by volunteers and these extended practice hours are only available to you because of the continued dedication and     hard work of a small number of people.&nbsp; Less than 1% of our members are regular helpers at the club.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember that volunteering and helping     out, even if only for an hour or so, is guaranteed to improve your shooting (laws of karma!).     </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Happy shooting</span>
